# Web Browser Project
The Web Browser Project is a detailed and practical venture into the development of a basic web browser. Inspired by real-world architectures of modern browsers, this project is based on Python 3, utilizing libraries for TLS connections, and JavaScript evaluation. Though the browser is simplified and not fully standards-compliant, its core architecture and functionality provide deep insights into the complexity of web browsers.

### Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in your command line.
3. Navigate to the downloaded project directory.
4. Install necessary dependencies
5. Run the browser using `python3 browser.py`.

### Features
- **Basic HTML Rendering:** Renders a simplified version of HTML content.
- **CSS Styling:** Limited support for CSS to style web pages.
- **JavaScript Interaction:** Uses DukPy for JavaScript evaluation, allowing basic interaction.
- **Simple Networking:** Support for HTTP and HTTPS protocols with basic TLS connections.
- **Custom GUI:** Utilizes the Tkinter library for graphical user interface.
- **Navigation Controls:** Basic back and forward navigation through web history.

### Advanced Features
- **Interactive Tabs:** Manage multiple webpages through tabbed browsing.
- **Form Handling:** Supports basic form submissions and input handling.
- **Event Handling:** Implements a simple event handling system for user interactions.
- **Custom Layout Engine:** Own implementation of a document layout engine for rendering pages.
- **Bookmark Management:** Basic functionality for bookmarking pages.
- **Script Execution Safety:** Rudimentary content security policy implementation.

### Programming Concepts Covered
- **Networking:** socket, urllib, and SSL modules for handling web requests.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Utilizing Tkinter for dynamic GUI updates.
- **Data Structures:** Efficient use of lists, dictionaries, and custom objects.
- **Error Handling:** Basic exception handling for network, rendering, and scripting errors.
- **Code Modularization:** Organized into multiple modules and classes for readability and maintenance.
